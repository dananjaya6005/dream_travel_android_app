## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a mobile application using Android Studio that aims to enhance the travel experience for users. The app provides a range of features designed to address common challenges and problems faced by travellers.
Travelers often struggle to find reliable and up-to-date information about travel-related news, local services, and attractions when visiting a new city or country. This lack of information can lead to wasted time, missed opportunities, and potentially unpleasant experiences during their trip.
To address these challenges, the app provides real-time travel news, city/place information, weather updates, local travel agent and restaurant details, time zone conversion, flight booking links, Google Maps integration and a in- built compass feature. By providing these features in one convenient location, the app aims to make travel planning and navigation easier and more enjoyable for users

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly travel app that offers a range of useful features to enhance the travel experience for users and address common challenges faced by travelers.
